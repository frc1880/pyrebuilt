# pyrebuilt

The Warriors' robot code for FRC REBUILT 2026

## Setup

### Install dependencies

We use `uv` to manage our dependencies in our development environments.
This includes the Python version, and any Python packages such as `wpilib`.

Install `uv` by following the [`uv` docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

After installing `uv`, download the roboRIO dependencies.

```sh
uv run robotpy sync --no-install
```

`uv run` will automatically create a virtual environment and install our dependencies for local development.

### pre-commit

[pre-commit][] is configured to run our formatters and linters.
These are enforced for all code committed to this project.

We recommend using [prek][] to run our pre-commit hooks.
See the [prek installation docs][] to install prek.

You can then set up the pre-commit hooks to run on commit:

```sh
prek install
```

### IDE setup

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Install the workspace's recommended extensions.
2. Copy `.vscode/settings.default.json` to `.vscode/settings.json`.

   ```sh
   cp .vscode/settings.default.json .vscode/settings.json
   ```

## Run

### Simulation

```
uv run robotpy sim
```

### Deploy to Robot

First, connect to the robot network. Then run:

```
uv run robotpy deploy
```

### Test

```
uv run robotpy test
```

### Type checking

We use mypy to check our type hints in CI. You can run mypy locally:

```sh
uv run mypy .
```

## Code Structure

We use RobotPy's Magicbot framework

`robot.py`: Entry point, has mapping from driver inputs to high level robot actions.

`components/`: Abstracts hardware into robot actions.

`controllers/`: Automates robot actions, mostly with state machines.

`autonomous/`: Controls robot during autonomous period.

`ids.py`: Has CAN ids, PH channels and other port numbers.
